This project will hold all the little utitilties and code snippets that I create in Ruby
that I intend to copy and paste into other programs as needed.

I have a nice little blog where I post simple solutions that I create, encounter, or wish for.
It is at http://www.johnvarghese.com. Please visit there to see if you find any solutions 
that might suit you.

I also have a startup in the making - a one man company that aims to create beautiful
software that is both functional and engaging at the same time. I want to help you create
softwares that span the following areas: Mobile, SaaS, Web Applications.

I distribute these code snippets under the creative commons attribution license. Please feel
free to use it in your projects.
